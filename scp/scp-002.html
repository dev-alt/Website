          <p>
            SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all
            times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case
            of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and
            the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once
            facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and
            ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed
            to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment
            area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times. Teams
            including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters
            of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain
            physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is
            another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or
            influenced by proximity to the object. No personnel below Level 3
            are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via
            written authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators.
            Command staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least five
            (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and
            must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance.
            Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5 km from
            SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and
            psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych
            staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine
            expires.
          </p>
          <h4>Description:</h4>
          <p>
            SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly
            60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its
            interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of
            modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though
            no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains
            furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted
            bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced
            by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or
            fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room. Refer to the
            Mulhausen Report [cross-ref:document00.023.603] for details related
            to object's discovery.
          </p>
          <h4>Reference:</h4>
          <p>
            To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of
            seven personnel. It has also in its time at the facility further
            furnished itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio,
            a beanbag chair, three books in an unknown language, four children's
            toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals
            including higher primates have failed to provoke a response in
            SCP-002. Cadavers as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever
            process the subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings
            is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of living humans.

            <p>Mulhausen Report docid:00.023.603</p>
            <p>
              The following is a brief report detailing the discovery of SCP-002
            </p>
            <p>
              Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal
              where it struck the Earth from orbit. Encased in a shell of thick
              rock, the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact.
              A native farmer happened upon the site and reported his findings
              to the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4
              agent posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly
              generated by the object.
            </p>
            <p>
              A collection squad of SCP security personnel led by General
              Mulhausen was immediately dispatched to the area where they
              quickly secured the subject in a large container and performed
              initial testing with subjects recruited from the nearby village.
              Three men individually sent into the structure subsequently
              disappeared. Upon discovering this deadly property of the subject,
              General Mulhausen issued a Level 4a Termination Order of any
              witnesses (roughly 1/3 of the village) to ensure no outside
              knowledge of the object and initiated its transport to SCP
              facility [DATA EXPUNGED].
            </p>
            <p>
              During preparation for transport, four SCP security personnel were
              inexplicably drawn inside the object where they too immediately
              disappeared. Following inspection, it appeared as if the object
              had "grown" several new furnishings and was beginning to look like
              the interior of an apartment room. General Mulhausen immediately
              ordered the requisition of several Class III HAZMAT suits for the
              remaining security team members, who proceeded to lift the
              container onto a waiting freight ship for transport to the SCP
              containment facility.
            </p>
            <p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
            <p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
            <p>
              Following the termination of General Mulhausen, SCP-002 was
              re-secured by SCP staff and brought into special containment in
              [CLASSIFIED], where it currently resides. Staff with clearance
              below Level 3 have been denied access to the SCP-002 container
              without prior approval of at least two Level 4 staff after the
              Mulhausen incident.
